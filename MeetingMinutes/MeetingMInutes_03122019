Agenda:
1. Go over classifiers and how they may help us in next Sprint

Notes:
CLASSIFIERS: we can create custom classifiers. we can input text as training data associated with classifiers we define. so, we could potentially use classifiers to recognize sentence structures associated with specific method structures. but I believe it uses word choice...
we'll find out together!
https://textblob.readthedocs.io/en/dev/classifiers.html
the example given in the documentation shows positive and negative classifiers to determine texts that are more positive and texts that are more negative

Vale:
I will be working on the Senior Project presentation and report on Thursday and Friday

Logan:
I'll be reviewing GitHub changes first, then knocking out some of the decision-making in Trello, and banging out a prototype for any of the things we want to have done this Sprint. Mostly just need to confirm our decisions in code.
For this sprint -- as far as our presentation this weekend is concerned -- we're pretty much split up into two jobs: Further developing the UI, and prototyping the interpreter.

Ti:
Same will be going over there tasks I took the other day

Shaina:
Creating graphs

To Do:
we could use them to identify sentence structures associated with method structures ahead of time
